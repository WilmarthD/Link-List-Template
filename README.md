# Link-List-Template
## - Steps to running the program
- Download the repository with all files and folders
- Run **"make"** or **"make all"** from the main directory (not within the bin or obj folder)
- Call executable
  - This can be done by typeing either **"./zll_sample"** from inside the bin directory or **"bin/./zll_sample"** from the main directory

### The main is located in _zll_sample.cpp_. To change the output and create your own ZLL instances, make changes there.

### _Crayon.h_ and _Crayon.cpp_ are examples of a class to be instantiated with the template class, though you can create your own to insert as well.
  > When createing your own class, you must either write over the code in Crayon, keeping the same file names, or adjust the makefile to include a new cpp file for compilation.
